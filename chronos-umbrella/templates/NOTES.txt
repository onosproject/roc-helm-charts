Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }} Helm chart.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }} in namespace {{.Release.Namespace}}.
See https://docs.onosproject.org/developers/deploy_with_helm/

To learn more about the release, try:
  $ helm -n {{.Release.Namespace}} status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm -n {{.Release.Namespace}} get all {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ watch kubectl -n {{.Release.Namespace}} get pods

NOTE: if you're deploying this with a name other than "chronos-umbrella" you will have to add
`--set aether-enterprise-portal.rasa.service=<name>-rasa`. This is because RASA Helm Chart can utilize `fullnameOverride`
See https://github.com/RasaHQ/helm-charts/issues/69
